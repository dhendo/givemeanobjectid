Give Me an ObjectID
================

I have two pain points with mongodb ObjectIDs:
- Quickly fabricating mongodb ObjectIDs for date range queries (with just the date component set).
- Going from an ObjectID to a date, without having an IDE or interpreter to hand

So I wrote a page to do just that. Enjoy.
